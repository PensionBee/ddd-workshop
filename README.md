# L&DDD - Typescript: The Useful Bits (+ Some Extra)

## Context

## The Practical Bit

First, install the `node_modules` with `npm install`. This should provide the necessary `typescript` support to work through this section.

In the `src/problems` directory you'll find two problem sets. The first one is the 'If you can do this then you can work effectively in Typescript codebases' set. There's a lot to Typescript and you probably won't need most of it 99% of the time. The basics are where it's at. Seriously! Check out the hints in each exercise which should guide you towards the solutions. We're here to learn, not bang our heads off a wall so use the docs and any other resources on the internet as much as you need. 60% of programming is about reading Stack Overflow andswers and copying documentation anyway...

The second set focuses on generics and some other advanced TS concepts, which can be super useful for building shared utility functions or libraries. If you're just like 'NOPE, I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS RIGHT NOW!!!' then no worries... Make yourself a hot beverage and skip over this set until you find yourself in a situation where the basics just don't quite cut it. However, if you're up for the challenge, this stuff's really not as hard as you might initially think, and if you can get through it, you're on your way to becoming a real TS wizard. Check out the hints in each exercise which should guide you towards the solutions.

The `src/solutions` directory has solutions to both problem sets. Note that there can sometimes be multiple ways to achieve the same thing in TS so don't worry if your solutions don't look the same as the ones provided. If it works, it works...
