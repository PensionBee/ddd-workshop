## The Practical Bit

First, run `nvm use` then `npm install` to make sure you have the necessary typescript support to work through this section.

In the **problems/** directory you'll find two problem sets...

- Set 1: The `If you can do this then you have a great foundation for working in a Typescript codebase` set. There's a lot to Typescript and you probably won't need most of it 95% of the time. The basics are where it's at - seriously! Check out the hints in each exercise which should guide you towards a solution.
- Set 2: This focuses on generics and a couple of other more advanced TS concepts, which are very useful for building libraries or shared utilities. If you're up for the challenge, this stuff probably isn't as difficult as you might initially think, and if you can get through it, you're on your way to becoming a real TS wizard. Remember to check out the hints which should help guide you towards a solution. However, if you're just like 'NOPE, I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS RIGHT NOW!!' then no worries... Make yourself a hot beverage and ignore this stuff until you find yourself in a situation where the basics just don't quite cut it.
