# L&DDD - Typescript: The Useful Bits (+ Some Extra)

## The Practical Bit

First, install the `node_modules` with `npm install`. This should provide the necessary `typescript` support to work through this section.

In the `problems` directory you'll find two problem sets. The first one is the 'If you can do this then you can work effectively in Typescript codebases' set. There's a lot to Typescript and you probably won't need most of it 99% of the time. The basics are where it's at - seriously! Check out the hints in each exercise which should guide you towards a solution - use any resources you need as much as you want.

The second problem set focuses on generics and some other advanced TS concepts, which can be super useful for building shared utility functions or libraries. If you're just like 'NOPE, I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS RIGHT NOW!!!' then no worries... Make yourself a hot beverage and skip this set until you find yourself in a situation where the basics just don't quite cut it - maybe this will be next month, maybe next year, maybe never. However, if you're up for the challenge, this stuff probably isn't as difficult as you might initially think, and if you can get through it, you're on your way to becoming a real TS wizard. Remember to check out the hints.

*Note: there are solutions to these problems on the `typescript-solutions` branch*
