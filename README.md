## Context

You've just been hired at `SocialBee` - the next big social media app (I promise).

The company has big plans to revolutionise this space but first they've got to get on the radar, which means they need an MVP out the door ASAP, with the ability to respond to change quickly and support increasingly complex business requirements in the future

Your product manager comes to you on day 1 with a small list of requirements.

> "Right, here's what we need:
>
> 1. New customers should be able to create a new account with just an email, username and password. Plus the usual login, logout stuff too.
>
> What? Someone's already done that? Nice! In that case:
>
> 2. They should be able to post updates, a 'Post' I suppose it'd be called, and they should be visible to everyone on the platform via some central feed
> 3. People should also be able to follow accounts they like. The feed should have an 'All Posts' filter and a 'Following Posts' filter.
> 4. Ohh, comments are important too. Anyone can comment on any other post.
>
> That's about it I suppose so you can probably get cracking. Oh yeah, the design doesn't matter too much at this point so go wild... We do have access to this 'component library' thing though so you can probably use that."
