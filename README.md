## The Practical Bit

First, install `node_modules` with `npm install`. This should provide the necessary `typescript` support to work through this section.

In the `problems` directory you'll find two problem sets...

- Set 1: The `If you can do this then you have a great foundation for working in a Typescript codebase` set. There's a lot to Typescript and you probably won't need most of it 95% of the time. The basics are where it's at - seriously! Check out the hints in each exercise which should guide you towards a solution but feel free to use any resources you can to solve the problem and improve your understanding.
- Set 2: This focuses on generics and couple of other advanced TS concepts, which can be very useful for building libraries or shared utility functions. If you're just like 'NOPE, I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS RIGHT NOW!!!' then no worries... Make yourself a hot beverage and skip this set until you find yourself in a situation where the basics just don't quite cut it. However, if you're up for the challenge, this stuff probably isn't as difficult as you might initially think, and if you can get through it, you're on your way to becoming a real TS wizard. Remember to check out the hints which should help guide you towards a solution.
